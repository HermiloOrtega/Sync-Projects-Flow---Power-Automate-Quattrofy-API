# üîÑ Sync Projects Flow ‚Äì Power Automate + Quattrofy API

## üß≠ Overview
**Sync Projects Flow** is a Power Automate flow developed to orchestrate real-time data synchronization across critical internal systems at **Quattro Constructors**. The automation connects to the **Quattrofy API** and triggers a back-end process that keeps project data consistent between **Finance**, **Safety**, and **Operations** platforms‚Äîensuring a single source of truth with no manual intervention.

---

## üí° Idea & Concept
Multiple business units rely on accurate project data for decision-making, reporting, and compliance. Manually updating systems leads to errors, delays, and inefficiencies. This flow automates the sync process to:
- Retrieve the latest project data from external sources.
- Propagate updated financial data across all connected platforms.
- Send operational updates to the financial system.

This ensures **all departments work with the most current and aligned project data**.

---

## ‚ú® Features & Functionality
- **Scheduled Automation**: Triggers daily or hourly to check for updates.
- **HTTP Request**: Securely calls a Quattrofy API endpoint to execute the sync logic.
- **Cross-System Syncing**:
  - Pulls latest data from finance platform.
  - Pushes operational updates to financial systems.
  - Propagates master project data to all systems.
- **High-Fidelity Validation**:
  - Ensures no duplication or data corruption.
  - Only applies confirmed changes.
